# Multithreading-sorting-application
multithreaded sorting program that works as follows:

A list of integers is divided into two smaller lists of equal size. Two separate threads (which we will term sorting threads) sort each sub-list using a sorting algorithm of your choice. The two sub-lists are then merged by a third thread—a merging thread —which merges the two sub-lists into a single sorted list.

Command to run - java MultithreadedSorting.java
